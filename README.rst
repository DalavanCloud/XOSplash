General
=======

XOSplash is a simple to use controller implementing seamless splash image and
video on iPhone and iPad. You'll find it useful when you want to use both a
splash image and video on application launch. Alternatively you can just play a
video and not use a splash image, but using that approach you launch with a
black screen and it can be up to a couple seconds before your users see things
kick off.

With the approach provided by XOSplash your branding image will immediately
appear and the video will begin to play as quickly as possible thereafter. 

This can be especially useful when you'd like to show a splash/intro video on
the first launch and would prefer to stick to a simple splash image on
subsequent launches.
